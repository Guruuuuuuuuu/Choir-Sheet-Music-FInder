## Request 1: Capriccio - SATB with Overtone Singing, Spring Earth Theme

### CPDL Database Results
❌ **No exact matches found** in CPDL (Choral Public Domain Library)

**Reason**: Overtone singing is a very specialized contemporary vocal technique that is rarely found in public domain classical choral music, which is what CPDL primarily contains.

### Suggested Alternatives

#### From Bot's Knowledge Base:
1. **"Singing in Tune with Nature"** by Amanda Cole
   - **Voicing**: SATB
   - **Technique**: Overtone singing / Microtonal just intonation
   - **Theme**: Nature/Earth
   - **Difficulty**: Advanced
   - **Source**: N.E.O. Voice Festival 2020
   - **Note**: This is a contemporary piece and may not be in CPDL (which focuses on public domain works)

#### General SATB Pieces Found in CPDL:
- "Ave Maria (SATB)" by Lorenzo Perosi
  - URL: https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Ave_Maria_(SATB)_(Lorenzo_Perosi)
- "Dostoyno yest (SATB)" by Dmitri Bortniansky
  - URL: https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Dostoyno_yest_(SATB)_(Dmitri_Bortniansky)
- "Heruvimskaya pesn' (SATB)" by Dmitri Bortniansky
  - URL: https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Heruvimskaya_pesn%27_(SATB)_(Dmitri_Bortniansky)

**Recommendation**: For overtone singing pieces, you may need to search contemporary music publishers or contact composers directly, as this technique is not commonly found in traditional choral repertoire.
